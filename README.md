### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

  My name is Matthew, I'm a full-stack developer with experience running large, and optimized applications. I've been programming since the 2nd, or 3rd grade; since then I've learned a multitude of languages, systems, and programs. I love running, even if I'm not the fastest person in the world, and have a strong passion for photography.
  
  In Q3-4 of 2020 I plan on learning languages such as C, C++, C#, and Java to add-on to my current Node, PHP, HTML/CSS/JS, and Lua experience. I'm experienced with MySQL, Ubuntu Server, RESTful APIs, NGINX, Discord APIs, XMPP feeds, security best practices, and the languages listed before hand. I try my best to write clean code that won't need to be refactored after a month, as I like to plan, then write -- though most of my planning comes while I am writing code.
  
  If you like the weather, I do too. I've worked on a ton of projects that revolve around the weather, primaraly for warning parsing, and redistrubition; though I do plan on working on forecasting tools, and models. Though that's kinda far off.
