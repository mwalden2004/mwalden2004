### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

  My name is Matthew. I'm a full-stack developer with experience running large and optimized applications. I've been programming since the 2nd or 3rd grade; since then, I've learned many languages, systems, and programs. I love running, even if I'm not the fastest person in the world, and have a strong passion for photography.
  
  I plan on learning languages such as C, C++, C#, and Java to add-on to my current Node, PHP, HTML/CSS/JS, and Lua experience. I'm experienced with MySQL, Ubuntu Server, RESTful APIs, NGINX, Discord APIs, XMPP feeds, security best practices, and the languages listed beforehand.
  
  If you like the weather, I do too. I've worked on many projects that revolve around the weather, primarily for warning parsing and redistribution, though I do plan on forecasting tools and models -- that's kind of far off though.

### New Stuff

I've recently gotten into Kubernetes and managed infastructure. I am currently working on a project that uses Kubernetes and Github to create scalable releases worldwide.

### Experience

I've worked on a platform with over 30,000 users, and well after created another one which has gotten up to 20,000 users. So, I've worked with a lot of people, and have managed large teams of voulnteers to handle user tickets, and help provide the best experience possible to users.
