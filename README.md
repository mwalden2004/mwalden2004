### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matthew. I'm a full-stack developer with experience running large and optimized applications. I've been programming since the 2nd or 3rd grade; since then, I've learned many languages, systems, and programs.
  
I'm experienced with MySQL, Ubuntu Server, RESTful APIs, NGINX, Discord APIs, XMPP feeds, security best practices, HTML, CSS, JS, TypeScript, Node.JS, Vercel, Lua, DigitalOcean, Docker, Kubernetes, and a lot of other things.
  
### Experience

I've created a platform with over 30,000 users, and well after created another one which has gotten up to 20,000 users. So, I've worked with a lot of people, and have managed large teams of voulnteers to handle user tickets, and help provide the best experience possible to users.

I am a independent contractor primarily working for Blox Works, which is responsible for creating Bloxlink a service powering over six-million users. I am responsible for developing their next-generation website using Next.JS, and FoalTs.

### Outside Computers

I love running, and spend a lot of my free-time logging miles. See my Strava! https://www.strava.com/athletes/48783724
