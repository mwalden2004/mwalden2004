### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I've been developing websites since I was seven years-old. Now I'm 18 and have created many services and products used by people all around the globe. Through my products I've been able to experience running customer-support teams, managing customer expectations, and product design. I now contract mainly for Bloxlink, a Roblox to Discord verification platform which boasts over 10-million verified users.

Outside of programming, I like to run, mountain bike, talk on HAM radio, study weather phenomena, fly drones as a licensed Part-107 pilot, and take pictures. I've also created a light-show for my community called Lights on Angel which was featured on the [Anniston Star](https://www.annistonstar.com/news/jacksonville/self-proclaimed-weather-nerd-creates-light-show-in-jacksonville/article_28e2007a-7822-11ed-af42-63159a610c4b.html), you can see a preview of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEaAXJv5EQI&t=0s).

### Outside Computers
  
I love running, and spend a lot of my free-time logging miles. See my Strava! https://www.strava.com/athletes/48783724
