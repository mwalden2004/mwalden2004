# Hi, I'm Matthew ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 19-year-old full-stack developer with a passion for creating web applications and Discord bots. I've been developing websites since I was seven and have had the opportunity to work on numerous projects, some with dedicated communities. Currently, I'm contracting mainly for [Bloxlink](https://blox.link), a Roblox to Discord verification platform with over 10 million verified users.

Apart from programming, I enjoy running, mountain biking, HAM radio, studying weather phenomena, flying drones as a licensed Part-107 pilot, and photography. I also created a light-show for my community called "Lights on Angel," featured on the Anniston Star.
