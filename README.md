# Hi, I'm Matthew üëã

I'm a 21-year-old full-stack developer with a passion for creating web applications and Discord bots. I've been developing websites since I was very young and have had the opportunity to work on numerous projects, some with dedicated communities. Currently, I'm working at State Farm as a Software Engineer, and on [ReAdmin](https://readmin.app), a Roblox HR platform.

Apart from programming, I enjoy running, mountain biking, HAM radio, studying weather phenomena, flying drones as a licensed Part-107 pilot, and photography. I also created a light-show for my community called "Lights on Angel," featured on the [Anniston Star](https://www.annistonstar.com/news/jacksonville/self-proclaimed-weather-nerd-creates-light-show-in-jacksonville/article_28e2007a-7822-11ed-af42-63159a610c4b.html).
